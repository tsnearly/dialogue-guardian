# TODO: Enhance test_censor_audio_with_ffmpeg_integration

- [x] Add imports for re and srt modules
- [x] Parse the SRT file to identify censored segments based on profanity matching
- [x] For each censored segment, use ffmpeg astats to check RMS audio level
- [x] Assert that RMS is below 0.01 for each censored segment to confirm silence

Test enhancement completed. The test now analyzes the audio stream to confirm silence in censored segments by parsing SRT for profanity, identifying muted times, and using ffmpeg astats to verify RMS levels are below 0.01.
