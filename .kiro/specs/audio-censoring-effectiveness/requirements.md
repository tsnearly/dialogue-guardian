# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dialogue-guardian system currently has an issue with audio censoring effectiveness. Integration tests are failing because censored audio segments are not achieving the expected silence level of -50 dB or lower. The current implementation only reduces audio to approximately -28 dB, which is insufficient for proper censoring. This feature addresses improving the audio censoring mechanism to ensure profane segments are properly silenced.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content moderator, I want profane audio segments to be completely silenced, so that censored content meets broadcast standards and quality expectations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profane content is detected in subtitles THEN the system SHALL reduce audio volume to -50 dB or lower during those segments
2. WHEN audio censoring is applied THEN the system SHALL use appropriate FFmpeg filters to achieve complete silence
3. WHEN censored segments are analyzed THEN the RMS level SHALL be below -50 dB threshold
4. WHEN no profane content is detected THEN the system SHALL preserve original audio quality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the audio censoring integration tests to pass consistently, so that the system reliability is validated and deployment confidence is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN the test_censor_audio_with_ffmpeg_integration SHALL pass without assertion errors
2. WHEN audio segments are tested for silence THEN the astats filter SHALL report RMS levels below -50 dB
3. WHEN multiple profane segments exist THEN each segment SHALL individually meet the silence threshold
4. WHEN tests are executed repeatedly THEN the results SHALL be consistent and reproducible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the audio censoring to work across different audio formats and configurations, so that the system handles diverse media content effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing videos with different audio codecs THEN the system SHALL apply censoring effectively regardless of format
2. WHEN processing stereo or multi-channel audio THEN the system SHALL silence all channels in profane segments
3. WHEN processing videos with varying sample rates THEN the system SHALL maintain censoring effectiveness
4. WHEN output is generated THEN the system SHALL preserve video quality while ensuring audio censoring

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want detailed logging and verification of censoring effectiveness, so that I can troubleshoot issues and validate system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio censoring is applied THEN the system SHALL log the specific segments being censored
2. WHEN FFmpeg commands are executed THEN the system SHALL log the exact filter parameters used
3. WHEN censoring fails to meet thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information
4. WHEN verification is performed THEN the system SHALL report actual RMS levels achieved
