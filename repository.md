Excellent choice. "Dialogue Guardian" is a strong name that perfectly captures the project's philosophy.

For the actual file and project names, the key is to use simple, consistent, and command-line-friendly versions of that name. Here are the standard conventions and my recommendations:

### Project / Repository Name

For the overall project folder or a GitHub repository, the most common convention is **kebab-case** (all lowercase with hyphens).

* **Recommendation:** `dialogue-guardian`

This is clean, readable, and the standard for naming projects on platforms like GitHub.

### Python Script Filename (`.py`)

This is the name you'll type in the terminal (`python filename.py ...`), so it benefits from being clear and concise. The standard Python convention (PEP 8) is **snake_case** (all lowercase with underscores).

Here are a few excellent options, in order of my recommendation:

1.  **`guardian.py`**
    * **Why:** This is short, powerful, and very easy to type on the command line. It captures the essence of the name without the extra length.

2.  **`dialogue_guardian.py`**
    * **Why:** This is the most descriptive and directly follows Python's naming conventions. It's a great choice if you prefer clarity over brevity.

3.  **`hush.py`**
    * **Why:** This uses one of our previous ideas as a simple, memorable "code name" for the script itself. It's a single, elegant command to type.

### Summary

A common and excellent setup would be:
* **GitHub Repository:** `dialogue-guardian`
* **Script Filename:** `guardian.py`
